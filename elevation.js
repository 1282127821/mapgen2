/** Elevation is based on breadth first search from the seed points,
 * which are the coastal graph nodes. Since breadth first search also
 * calculates the 'parent' pointers, return those for use as the downslope
 * graph. To handle lakes, which should have all corners at the same elevation,
 * there are two deviations from breadth first search:
 * 1. Instead of pushing to the end of the queue, push to the beginning.
 * 2. Like uniform cost search, check if the new distance is better than
 *    previously calculated distances. It is possible that one lake corner
 *    was reached with distance 2 and another with distance 3, and we need
 *    to revisit that node and make sure it's set to 2.
